# Create Course boilerplate

Create a course boilerplate using Vite.

#### Install Vite

Open a command prompt on your system somewhere.
`npm create vite@latest`
Next, enter a project name. This will be used as the root folder name of our project.
`Three.js-TypeScript-Boilerplate`
Press Enter at the next prompt to confirm the package name. Note that it has lower-case letters and also replaced the period sign.

`? Package name: Â» three-js-typescript-boilerplate`

Select the `Vanilla` framework option.

And then select the `TypeScript` option.

It will scaffold a new project in a folder named `Three.js-TypeScript-Boilerplate`

We should change directory to that new folder,
`cd Three.js-TypeScript-Boilerplate`

Install required packages as shown in the new package.json file,
`npm install`
And then we can run the dev version of the project.
`npm run dev`
If all is well, we should see a message that our project is available at http://localhost:5173/

Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser.

It shows a basic template configured for writing Vanilla JS in TypeScript.
